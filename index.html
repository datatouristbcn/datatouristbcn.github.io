							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								Housing has been a trendy topic during the last years in Barcelona, specially concerning house renting. Prices have raised dramatically, surpassing even the maximum level reached just before the financial crisis in 2008.
								One may think that in this situation, salaries have increased accordingly, but the truth is that they have barely increased during the last years therefore as a consequence, 
								most people are struggling to pay their monthly rent or to find a flat that fits them economically.  <br>
								<br>
								So, then we can wonder why is this happening. There are two main explanations given by the local authorities and by the people living in Barcelona. One is that increase tourism and the raise of
								Airbnb in the city have caused a decrease in the offer of flats for renting. The other is that a bubble has been formed regarding rental apartments. <br>
								<br>
								With these two main problems in mind, local authorities have regulated accordingly. First, they regulated touristic flats, they should be registered and 
								complain with the law. And lately they have been discussing about limiting the rental price.<br>
								<br>
								The purpose of this section is to let you investigate on the different neighborhoods in Barcelona. Therefore, we have created a dynamic graphical app to 
								show the evolution of rental prices, Airbnb listings and Airbnb prices per night on every neighborhood in Barcelona per year. <br>
								<br>
								You can use the app by going over the different neighborhoods in the map of the city. When you go over one of them, the other plots change accordingly.
								You can select which feature investigate in the dropdown.<br>
								<br>
								There is also a scatterplot showing graphically the relationship between the increase in rental price and the increase in Airbnb’s presence for every neighborhood. This plot helps us better understand 
								if an increase of Airbnb offer in a specific neighborhood directly translates into an increase of the average rental price of houses.<br>
								<br>
								Please go ahead and play with it, depending on your screen you may need to resize your browser window to better visualize it. We recommend to see 
								all the 4 graphs at the same time. For a full-screen visualization go here: <a href="https://sodata2.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">find the app here</a><br>
							        <br>
								<b> - Increase in rent is not so much correlated with Airbnb growth</b></li><br>
										From this first graphical analysis we cannot see so much correlation between both rental price increase and Airbnb growth in the neighborhoods. <br>
										Some interesting examples that this rule is not applying are the neighborhoods of l’Eixample or La Barceloneta in which Airbnb has increased significantly but rental price has not done the same.

								<br>
								<b>- The neighborhoods where Airbnb is more active</b></li><br>
										The neighborhoods where Airbnb has more presence are: El barri Gotic, L'Eixample, el Raval and Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera
								<img src="assets/images/housing/airbnb.PNG" alt="Choropleth map showing rental price distribution over the city of Barcelona in 2015" height="600" width="1000">
								<br>
								<b>- The difference between the most expensive and the cheapest neighborhoods have been reduced</b></li><br>
								           Looking at the difference between the rental price/m2 distribution in the map in 2015 and the same in 2019 we see that in this period all neighborhood are more expensive.

								The demograpics section provides some insights about the population of Barcelona City, which is sectorized in ten different districts each of them with several neightborhoods. The demographics topics selected are: 
								Birth/death rate and Internal migration. <br><br>
							</h3>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								Births and deaths within a city are important data which helps to understand if a population is growing or it is rather shrinking. 
								The different neighborhoods from Barcelona are depicted by each dot in the visualization. 
								The labels indicate the growth or decline in the population of each neighborhood and the panels allow the user to select the year.<br><br>

								In an overview, the visualization shows a negative rate of growth in Barcelona city, having more deaths than births in many neighborthoods, 
								like Montbau in Horta-Guinardó or Vallbona in Nou Barris, which populations decline along the three-year period. Despite that, 
								some districts like Sant Andreu and Sant Martí have an increase in their population along the three years. Some neighborhoods with positive rate of 
								growth are Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou, which number of births double the number of deaths every year, and la Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in 
								San Martí district or la Trinitat Vella in Sant Andreu.<br><br>

								From a population perspective, Barcelona is the second largest city in Spain and then it is interesting to observed the migraion flows between neighborhoods and districts. 
								The internal migration visualization below displays the migration movement from each neighborhood to the selected district and for the picked year.<br><br>

								Looking at the visualization it is easy to observe that the districts that welcome more people every year are Eixample, where you can find most of the art work from the famous 
								architect Antoni Gaudí, Sant Martí, which is the easternmost district and was redevelop for the Olympics, and Sants-Montjuïc, which is located in the south and it is one of the 
								largest districts in the city. In opposite, the district with least migration is Les Corts, which is also the least populated district in the city. Some other interesting insights 
								about migration flows between districts may be found by the reader interacting with the visualization. <br><br>

								For the first time in history, more than 50 percent of the world’s population now lives in towns and cities. By 2050, this number is expected to increase to 66 percent.  
								Urban trees can help to mitigate some of the negative impacts and social consequences of urbanization, and thus make cities more resilient to these changes. Trees provide its citizens shade during the summer, beautify the neighbourhoods, help reduce noise and air pollution, and support urban wildlife.
								Further than these priceless benefits, our urban forest return includes stormwater interception, energy conservation, air pollutant removal, and carbon dioxide storage.  
								Our publicly owned trees are as much of an asset to us as our streets, sewers, bridges, and public buildings.<br><br>


								People in cities live in a constant rush. Hyperconnection through social networks barely let them move the eyes out of the smartphone screen and observe the surroundings. Urban trees are a silent part of the cities' landscape. However, they are certainly unknown for us, but hopefully Data Visualization is going to help us discover some insights, such as:<br>
								- Which are the most common tree species?<br>
								- How are they distributed?<br>
								- How many trees per inhabitant does Barcelona have?<br>
								- Which type of irrigation is nowadays used?<br>
								- Which is the oxygen balance of Barcelona (i.e. trees produced oxygen vs consumed by people)? <br>
					      	</p>
							<br>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								Barcelona has as much as <b>203.240</b> urban trees.<br>
								There is a diversity of <b>439</b> different tree species.
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/trees/trees_wc.png" alt="Trees wordcloud" height="500" width="500">
								<br>
								Barcelona territory is <b>101.3</b>  squared kilometres and the total population in 2019 was <b>1.636.762</b> inhabitants.
								<br>
								According to some estimations, a tree produces around 100 kg of oxygen every year, while each inhabitant consumes around 740 kg of oxygen every year.
								<br>
								Considering these data, Barcelona has a total of <b>2.006</b> trees/square km, the rate of trees per inhabitant is <b>0,12</b> trees/inhabitant and the delta of oxygen (i.e. oxygen produced by trees-oxygen consumed by people) is <b>-1190.88</b> millions of kg.
								<br>

								<br>
								The trees irrigation methods are divided into 6 categories.
								Drip and Hose are the most used methods. Drip was the most installed type, with a big difference, during the years 2010 and 2011. Since then, new trees keep using Drip but the trend went down. Instead, hose usage increased during 2016 and 2017 to drop again in 2018.
								<br>
								The following plot shows the distribution of trees date of planting according to the irrigation type by Year and Year-Month:
								<br>
								<iframe width="1000" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~arnau.gp/32.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								When comparing trees irrigation type with the tree pit surface or support, drip, sprinkling and diffusion show clear and interesting patterns.
								<br>
								- Drip is mainly used when the Tree pit surface is pavement. It is not the main irrigation type in any other Tree pit surface. Trees in the pavement (probably next to roads or in the streets) need the water in a concrete point and therefore other irrigation types that would spread water in a bigger space cannot be used.
								<br>
								- Sprinkling and diffusion are the main irrigation types when the Tree pit surfaces are grass, grass with vegetation and sandstone with vegetation. Trees in this surfaces are probably in gardens and parks, therefore the irrigation type is probably also irrigating the grass and plants around.
								<br>
								The following plots show the distribution of trees irrigation type according to the tree pit surface or support:

								<br>
								Now, it is time to see which is the relation between the tree specie and the size and edge of the tree pit.
								<br>
								The following plot shows the distribution of tree species according to the pit size:
								<br>

								<iframe width="1000" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~arnau.gp/34.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								- Platanus x hispanica is by far the dominating tree specie in the streets of Barcelona. Celtis australis is the second most common tree specie with about half of the total Platanus x hispanica trees.
								<br>
								- Prunus cerasifera is the specie with the highest increase in number of new plantations during the last decade.
								<br>
								- Celtis australis is the specie with the highest decrease in number of new plantations during the last decade.
								<br>
								- October until April are the months where most of the new plantations take place. Summer months register the lowest number of new plantations. High temperatures and people on holidays could be some of the reasons.
								<br>
								The following plots show the distribution of trees date of planting according to the specie:
								<br>
								<iframe width="1000" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~arnau.gp/46.embed"></iframe>

								<br>
								<iframe width="1000" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~arnau.gp/52.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								In the following density scatter plot it can be seen how the Top 6 tree species are distributed accross Barcelona using its coordinates representation. The location of trees is concentrated on the South-East side of the city. Platanus x hispanica highest concentration is in the East extreme of the city. Celta australis is clearly concentrated in Barcelona's downtown.
